# Ascent's Internal Style Guides

These style guides recommend patterns that real-world programmers can apply to their code that can be maintained by
other real-world programmers. A style guide that reflects real-world usage gets used, and a style guide that holds to an
ideal that has been rejected by the people it is supposed to help risks not getting used at all â€“ no matter how good it
is. <sup>[*](https://github.com/bbatsov/rails-style-guide#the-rails-style-guide)</sup>

These patterns are based on advice from professional software developers, feedback and suggestions from members of the
various languages' communities, and - most importantly - our own requirements and preferences.

## Contributing

Nothing written in these guides are set in stone. If the consensus of the team is to add/change/remove a guideline, then
we should update the guide as necessary.

To submit an improvement:

1.  Clone the repo.

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:ascent-technologies/ascent-style-guide.git
    ```

2.  Create a new local branch, and make your suggested changes.

3.  Open a new pull request.

4.  Solicit feedback from the rest of the Ascent development team.

Once a consensus has been reached, the PR will be merged or closed.
